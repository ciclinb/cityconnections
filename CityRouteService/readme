This project is a RESTful API developed using Spring Boot and using the Maven build tool. For ease of testing and to contain the focus of the project within the specified parameters, security, such as http basic or JWTs, on the API has not been implemented.
This API returns a string representation of the output as defined in the project requirements: "yes" if the cities are connected. Otherwise, "no". 

A sample of the cities data is in cities.txt in the resources directory of this project. This sample data are used to generate the responses.
